## **Issues in the Code**

1. **No Input Validation**:
   - The app doesnâ€™t validate user input (e.g., negative amounts or empty descriptions).
   - **Fix**: Add input validation and display error messages.

2. **No Categories for Transactions**:
   - Transactions are not categorized (e.g., Food, Travel).
   - **Fix**: Add a category field to the form and update the UI to display categories.

3. **No Monthly Budget Feature**:
   - The app doesnâ€™t allow users to set a monthly budget.
   - **Fix**: Add a budget input and display progress toward the budget.

4. **No Export Functionality**:
   - Users cannot export their transactions (e.g., as a CSV file).
   - **Fix**: Add an export button to download transactions.

5. **No Responsive Design**:
   - The app may not look good on smaller screens.
   - **Fix**: Add responsive CSS for mobile devices.

6. **No Undo Feature**:
   - If a user accidentally deletes a transaction, they cannot undo it.
   - **Fix**: Add an undo feature for deleted transactions.

7. **No Data Backup**:
   - If local storage is cleared, all data is lost.
   - **Fix**: Add a backup feature (e.g., export/import data).

8. **No Accessibility Features**:
   - The app lacks accessibility features like keyboard navigation or ARIA labels.
   - **Fix**: Add accessibility improvements for better usability.

9. **No Unit Tests**:
   - The app doesnâ€™t have any unit tests.
   - **Fix**: Add unit tests for critical functionality.

10. **No Error Handling for Chart.js**:
    - If Chart.js fails to load, the app doesnâ€™t handle it gracefully.
    - **Fix**: Add error handling for Chart.js initialization.
